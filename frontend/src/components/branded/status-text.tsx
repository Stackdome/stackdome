/**
 * Status, said once, as a word (§4, §7).
 *
 * **The colour is derived, never passed.** This component takes no `children`,
 * no `variant`, no `className` and no `style` — the only inputs are the domain
 * and the state string the backend actually sent, and both the word and the
 * colour fall out of them. That is the whole point of it.
 *
 * The Figma critique found the defect this replaces: `StatusPill` takes a
 * `variant` and its `children` separately, so nothing stops
 * `<StatusPill variant="error">Healthy</StatusPill>` — a red row that reads
 * "Healthy". A prop pair cannot be made safe by convention; it has to stop
 * being a pair. Callers that need a coloured word use this. `StatusPill`
 * remains for the bordered chip, where the word is genuinely fixed by the
 * caller.
 *
 * No dot. §7: a coloured dot at the left of a row AND the status word in a
 * column is saying it twice. The dot survives only where there is no room for
 * a word, which is not here.

/**
 * One glyph per **state** — and, like the colour, it is *derived* from domain +
 * state. It cannot be passed in, so an icon that disagrees with the word it
 * sits next to is as unbuildable as a colour that disagrees.
 *
 * **Why per state and not per family.** The first version had three glyphs for
 * three families, which meant `Degraded`, `Unavailable` and `Failed` all drew
 * the same triangle — and that is precisely the distinction that changes what
 * you do next. A glyph that cannot make the distinction the word makes is pure
 * chrome, which is why both call sites had switched icons off. Each state now
 * gets its own mark:
 *
 * | State | Glyph | Reads as |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | Healthy | `CircleCheck` | serving, nothing to do |
 * | Deploying | `Loader2`, spinning | in flight, wait |
 * | Degraded | `TriangleAlert` | serving, but not fully |
 * | Unavailable | `CircleOff` | not serving at all |
 * | Failed | `CircleX` | the deploy did not land |
 * | NotDeployed | `CircleDashed` | never run — a fact, not a fault |
 * | Deleting | `Trash2` | on its way out |
 *
 * Outline glyphs at the same stroke weight as every other icon in the product;
 * nothing here is filled. Colour still comes from the variant, so the glyph and
 * the word can never disagree about severity.
