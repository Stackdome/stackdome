// Workqueue operands. Must be comparable values, never pointers:
//   - the workqueue dedups and rate-limits by map-key equality,
//   - a pointer's map key is its address, so every allocation looks like
//     new work and duplicates accumulate for long-running operands,
//   - value keys also guarantee no two goroutines process the same
//     operand concurrently once workers run with multiple goroutines.
