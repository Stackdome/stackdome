# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

Stackdome — self-hosted PaaS that deploys/manages workloads across multiple Kubernetes clusters (Heroku-like: REST API, web UI, managed Postgres, git builds). Go API server + embedded React SPA.

## Architecture

**Hub-and-spoke.** Single API Server (hub) holds state in PostgreSQL and exposes REST + UI. Each managed cluster runs a `stackdome-agent` operator (spoke, Kubebuilder) that reconciles Custom Resources into K8s workloads.

- **Write path:** User → API Server → writes a Kubernetes CR → Cluster Agent → K8s resources (Deployment/Service/Ingress).
- **Status path:** Agent updates CR status → `pkg/controllers/*` controller-runtime watchers observe → PostgreSQL updated → UI/API reflect state.

Backend layering (`pkg/`): `handlers` (HTTP) → `services` (business logic) → `stores`/`pgstore` (DB). `presenters` convert model↔API. `builders` construct K8s objects. `clustermanager` multiplexes per-cluster connections. `worker/` does async reconciliation (managed by `workermanager`). `resourceaccess` = Casbin RBAC. `auth` = JWT/cookie. `validator/` is per-resource-type input validation. Entrypoints in `cmd/` (`servecmd`, `migratecmd`, `server` = routes/middleware).

The REST contract is `config/openapi/stackdome_api.yaml`. Go client (`pkg/api/openapi`) and frontend types/zod clients are **generated** from it — edit the spec, not generated code.

Frontend (`frontend/`, React 19 + Vite + Tailwind v4 + Radix) builds into `pkg/web/dist/` and is `go:embed`-ed into the server binary — no separate frontend deploy.

## Commands

Build system is **Mage** (`magefile.go`, namespaced targets); `Makefile` wraps some. Use `mage` for dev.

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Bootstrap local env (Postgres + Kind + RBAC) | `mage dev:setup` |
| DB migrations | `mage migrate` |
| Build + run API server | `mage run` |
| Tear down local env | `mage dev:teardown` |
| Backend unit tests | `mage test:unit` (or `make test`) |
| Single Go test | `go test ./pkg/<pkg>/ -run TestName` |
| Integration tests (needs Docker/Kind) | `mage test:integration` |
| Lint Go | `golangci-lint run ./...` (or `mage lint`) |
| Format Go | `mage fmt` |
| Regenerate mocks | `make mocks` (mockgen via `go:generate`; add new packages to the target) |
| Regenerate OpenAPI Go client | `make generate` |
| Build frontend only | `make frontend` |
| Frontend dev / test / lint | `pnpm --prefix frontend dev` / `test` / `lint` |
| Frontend OpenAPI types/zod | `pnpm --prefix frontend generate:openapi-types` / `:openapi-zod` |
| Storybook (component workshop) | `pnpm --prefix frontend storybook` (port 6006) |
| Story tests only | `pnpm --prefix frontend test:stories` |

Notes:
- `mage dev:setup` is idempotent; reads/writes `.env` (creates from `.env_template`), writes cluster creds to `dev_env.yaml`.
- `mage build` skips `tsc -b` so unrelated frontend type errors don't block the binary; frontend's own `pnpm build` does run `tsc -b`.
- Integration tests need `TEST_KUBECONFIG` pointing at a Mage-created Kind cluster (`mage cluster:create` / `cluster:delete`); state cached in `~/.cache/stackdome-api-server/clusters/`.
- New DB migration: scaffold with `hack/create_migration.sh`; ordered files live in `pkg/db/migrations/`.
- Full end-to-end demo env: `hack/run_local.sh [stack.json]`.
- **Tests use Ginkgo.** All Go tests are written with Ginkgo v2 + Gomega (`Describe`/`It`/`Expect`), never bare `testing.T` test functions. Ginkgo allows exactly one `RunSpecs` per package — if a suite bootstrap (`*_suite_test.go` or any `RunSpecs` call) already exists, add `var _ = Describe(...)` blocks to new files instead of a second suite. Existing bare-`testing.T` tests may stay, but new tests never add to them.
- **Mocks:** Always use `go.uber.org/mock/gomock` + `mockgen`. Never hand-roll mock structs. For package-private interfaces, generate mocks in-package with `mockgen -source=<file>.go -destination=<file>_mock.go -package=<pkg>` and add a `//go:generate` directive to the source file. Generated mock files do NOT take a `_test` suffix — `<file>_mock.go`, never `<file>_mock_test.go`. Existing generated mocks live in `pkg/mocks/` (for exported interfaces) and `*_mock.go` files (for in-package interfaces); older `*_mock_test.go` files may be renamed when their package is next touched.
- **No magic strings.** Always use defined constants (model enums, annotation keys, state values, error codes) instead of raw string literals. This applies to both production code and tests — e.g. use `models.ReleaseStateReleased` not `"Released"`, `models.SkipClusterProvisioningAnnotation` not `"stack.stackdome.io/skip-cluster-provisioning"`. If no constant exists and one is needed, define it first. If a raw string is truly unavoidable, get explicit approval before using it.
- **Frontend UI work starts in Storybook.** Build and review components at `pnpm --prefix frontend storybook` — it runs entirely on mocked data, so no Go server or Kind cluster is needed, including for streaming views (releases, logs, metrics, build logs). New or changed components get a colocated `<component>.stories.tsx` covering the states that matter: the happy path plus the ones that break in production (empty, error, long text, overflow, read-only, disconnected stream). Sidebar placement comes from an explicit `title` (`Foundations` / `Primitives` / `Branded` / `Features` / `Pages`), not the file path.
- **Stories are tests.** `pnpm test:run` runs two vitest projects: the jsdom unit suite, then every story rendered in headless Chromium with its `play` function executed. Both run in CI, so a change that breaks a story fails the build. Keep the projects sequenced (`sequence.groupOrder` in `frontend/vitest.config.ts`) — run in parallel they starve each other into timeouts. Add a `play` only where it proves something the render doesn't (an interaction, async data arriving, an aria state, portal content); variant-only stories need none.
- **Shared story setup lives in `frontend/.storybook/`,** not in story files: `fixtures.ts` (typed factories off the generated OpenAPI schemas), `msw-handlers.ts` (baseline auth/org handlers every story inherits), `sse.ts` (scripted `text/event-stream` frames for the EventSource hooks), `decorators.tsx` (providers, ReactFlow harness). Mock at the network boundary — never refactor a component just to make it story-able.
- **No defensive programming.** Never write `if s.someValidator != nil { ... }` around work that must always happen (validation, authorization, persistence), and do NOT add explicit nil-check-and-panic guards in constructors either (`if spec.X == nil { panic(...) }`). A missing required dependency is a wiring bug: just use the dependency unconditionally and let the natural nil-pointer panic surface it — e2e tests catch mis-wiring. Nil-guards are only acceptable for genuinely optional behavior where nil substitutes a default implementation (e.g. `RegistryClients` → real client) — never where nil silently skips the work. Tests wire every seam with mocks instead of relying on skip-when-nil.

## Agent skills

Superpowers is the workflow **spine** for all tasks: `superpowers:brainstorming` → spec (`docs/superpowers/specs/`), `superpowers:writing-plans` → plan (`docs/superpowers/plans/`), `superpowers:executing-plans`/TDD/debugging per superpowers. The repo-local skills in `.claude/skills/` are permitted as below; some gate on a superpowers artifact, others are off-spine utilities. `tdd`, `write-a-skill`, `caveman` are intentionally absent — the superpowers / global-plugin equivalents are authoritative.

| Skill | Use only | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| `ingest-design-bundle` | Claude Design URL → design-ref | none (inbound intake) |
| `grill-with-docs` | harden a spec/plan/design, sharpen glossary, extract ADRs | none (works best with a spec/plan) |
| `grill-me` | stress-test a plan/design in conversation | none (off-spine) |
| `handoff` | compact session → handoff doc | none (off-spine) |
| `to-prd` | spec → PRD issue | approved spec must exist |
| `to-issues` | plan → vertical-slice issues | plan must exist |
| `triage` | inbound external issue funnel | none (off-spine) |
| `zoom-out` | manual orientation | none (manual only) |

### Issue tracker

Issues and PRDs live in the `Stackdome/stackdome` GitHub repo (via the `gh` CLI). See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Canonical triage roles map 1:1 to label strings (`needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`). See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Multi-context: `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at root points to per-context `CONTEXT.md` files (backend root + `frontend/`; agent deferred). See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
